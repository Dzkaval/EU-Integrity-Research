# EU-Integrity-Research
Welcome on my EU Integrity research project!

As the European continent suffers through a genocidal war—the most dreadful
and blood-soaked conflict since World War II claiming thousands lives each day
and given the lack of an absolute consensus around nations on seemingly obvious
things, such as good and evil, I believe it is crucial to evaluate the real
risks and threats that may be arising within the very framework of one of
humanity’s greatest achievements: the European Union, a symbol of
voluntary cooperation, unity and striving to freedom for all.

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the disintegration trends
surrounding the European Union and quantify the degree of euroscepticism
in each EU member state. This is achieved by analyzing the political
landscape within individual countries and their representation in the
European Parliament.

To calculate the summary index, the following data points were processed
and analyzed:

- The proportion of political parties identified as eurosceptic and
  populist;
- Political affiliations and sympathies within the executive branch;
- Some general social and economic indicators by EU countries (HD index, 
  unemployment rate, GDP per capita, etc.)
